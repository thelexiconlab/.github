Welcome! This is the official account for the [Lexicon Lab](https://thelexiconlab.github.io/) at Bowdoin College. This account is managed by [Abhilasha Kumar](http://abhilashak.weebly.com/).

We are interested in how humans learn the meaning of words, how they communicate as social agents, and how search unfolds within the mental lexicon. We use experimental research methods, computational modeling, and psychological theory to study language and higher-order cognition.

Feel free to explore our public repositories! You can also visit our [research](https://thelexiconlab.github.io/research/) or [publications](https://thelexiconlab.github.io/publications/) page to know more about our work.

**Note**: All members of the lab will be added to this account. You may also be added to specific repositories (public/private) if you are contributing code and/or analyses.
